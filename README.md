# ecommerce
In this project, I built an e-commerce application using Node.js as the server-side runtime and MongoDB as the database. The application allows users 
to browse and purchase products. The Node.js server handles routing, data processing, and communicates with the MongoDB database to retrieve 
and update information. The application also includes features such as a shopping cart, user authentication and authorization using JWT 
authentication and bcrypt for hashing the password. Overall, the project demonstrates my ability to create a dynamic, full-featured web application 
using popular technologies such as Node.js and MongoDB. i have made an ecommerce application that can do CRUD operations on different 
categories and products.
